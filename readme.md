# **Cortex-EDU - A Full-Featured Learning Management System**

Cortex-EDU will be a modern, full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) designed for a seamless user experience for both students and instructors. The platform will be built with a focus on scalability, usability, and a rich feature set.

### **Core Features**

*   **User Roles:**
    *   **Admin:** Manages the entire platform, including users and courses.
    *   **Instructor:** Can create, manage, and publish courses.
    *   **Student:** Can enroll in and complete courses.
*   **Authentication:** Secure user registration and login with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
*   **Course Management:**
    *   Create, read, update, and delete courses (CRUD).
    *   Organize courses into modules and lectures.
    *   Upload course materials, including video lectures and reading materials.
*   **Student Enrollment & Progress:**
    *   Students can browse and enroll in courses.
    *   Track course progress, including completed lectures and modules.
*   **Interactive Learning:**
    *   **Quizzes:** Instructors can create quizzes for lectures and modules.
    *   **Q&A Section:** A dedicated section for students to ask questions and interact with instructors.
*   **User Dashboard:**
    *   **Student Dashboard:** View enrolled courses, progress, and achievements.
    *   **Instructor Dashboard:** Manage created courses, view student enrollment, and track student performance.

### **Technical Stack**

*   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, using a modern UI framework like Material-UI for a polished and responsive design.
*   **Backend:** The existing Node.js/Express server with TypeScript will be extended to support the new features.
*   **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose for flexible and scalable data storage.
*   **Deployment:** The entire application (frontend and backend) will be deployed on Vercel for a seamless and scalable hosting experience.

### **Development and Deployment Plan**

1.  **API Scaffolding (Backend):**
    *   Define and implement all necessary API endpoints for the features listed above.
    *   This includes creating new models, services, controllers, and routes for quizzes and Q&A sections.
2.  **Frontend Scaffolding (Frontend):**
    *   Set up a new React application using `create-react-app` with the TypeScript template.
    *   I will create this in a new `cortex-edu-client` directory.
3.  **Feature Implementation (Full-Stack):**
    *   I will develop the application feature by feature, starting with user authentication and course management.
    *   Each feature will be implemented on both the frontend and backend simultaneously.
4.  **Deployment & CI/CD:**
    *   The backend will be deployed to Vercel. I will configure the `vercel.json` file to handle the serverless functions.
    *   The frontend will also be deployed to Vercel, and I will configure CI/CD to automatically deploy new changes.
5.  **Documentation:**
    *   I will provide a comprehensive `readme.md` with instructions on how to set up, run, and deploy the application locally.
